Create variable centered_price containing a version of the price column with the mean price subtracted.

(Note: this 'centering' transformation is a common preprocessing step before applying various machine learning algorithms.)

centered_price = reviews.price.map(lambda x: x-reviews.price.mean())

I'm an economical wine buyer. Which wine is the "best bargain"? Create a variable bargain_wine with the title of the wine with the highest points-to-price ratio in the dataset.

bargain_idx = (reviews.points / reviews.price).idxmax()
bargain_wine = reviews.loc[bargain_idx, 'title']
